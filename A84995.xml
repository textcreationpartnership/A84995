         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> having taken <hi>Burlington</hi> Bay, the fartheſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Towne in the Eaſt-Riding of Yorkeſhire, and placed a Garriſon for the Parliament in it; he marched from thence into the North-Riding, and having paſſed
<pb facs="tcp:154590:3"/> over at <hi>Pottersbrimton,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Yerley,</hi> and quartering in thoſe parts, the Countrey of the ſaid Eaſt-Riding of Yorkeſhire, came in to him in an abundance; being very ready to take the Covenant, and to aſſiſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Papiſts and Prelates the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof.</p>
            <p>So that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> marched toward <hi>Whitby,</hi> a Haven Town in the fartheſt part of Yorkeſhire, with a very conſiderable Army; intending that if the Enemy would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the Town, to ſtorm it; for <hi>Whitby</hi> was a very ſtrong Garriſon of the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Enemy conſidering in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were, ſurrendred up the Towne to the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> wherein were above five hundred Captaines, Lieutenants, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Officers, and common Soldiers; beſides (at the leaſt) twenty of the Commiſſion of Aray, and almoſt a thouſand Sailers and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Town; all which have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the Town, and joyned themſelves with the Lord <hi>Fairfax;</hi> beſides forty ſhips which were then in the Channell.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154590:3"/>
            <p> Alſo the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſeized on all their Works, Ships, Powder, Ammunition, five hundred Armes, many Barrels of Powder, match, and other Ammunition, and traine of Artillery; and it is ſuppoſed, at the leaſt a hundred Peece of Ordnance in the Ships and upon the Workes; all which the Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> hath ſeized on for the uſe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>THe Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> (it ſeemes) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the danger he was in; and how probable it was that he might by all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood loſe, ſince not onely the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> encreaſed his ſtrength; but our Brethren of
<pb facs="tcp:154590:4"/> 
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo were ſo near him: and therefore the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Generall <hi>King,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of the chiefeſt Commanders went into <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> it is ſuppoſed, to try if they can eſcape away by Sea; but our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> are very glad to hear that they are there, for they have layd cloſe Siedge to it; and making an onſet upon them, beat upon their Workes, and with the loſſe of onely 14. men, ſlew many of the enemies, recovered the Glaſſe-houſes, and one of their Forts, not the leaſt conſiderable, and were got on both ſides the Towne; ſo that it is not any wayes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that they can hold out long.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> are quartered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Morpeth, Ogle-Caſtle, Seton, Prude;</hi> and as many as well can, lye before <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scots ſent forth a party, which with ſome Boates made as a Bridge over the River at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Brigade of Horſe and Foot, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, with ſome Ordnance, are marching towards <hi>Durham,</hi> and a party of them are to ſtay on the South ſide of Newcaſtle, in the
<pb facs="tcp:154590:4"/> Biſhopricke, to ſecure the Coale Pits on that ſide, and to keep the Enemy from firing them.</p>
               <p>In the taking of the <hi>Shelds</hi> there is no great difficulty, and <hi>Tinmouth</hi> Caſtle will be forced to yeild up, when Newcaſtle is taken. The Earle of Warwicks Ships lye before <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> to keep in the malignant Ships.</p>
               <p>So that now we may ſee a plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gods bleſſing, ſince the taking of the Covenant; there is no more now between the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and our Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſave only the Biſhopricke of <hi>Durham;</hi> for <hi>Whitby,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is adjacent to the hithermoſt part of the Biſhoprick, and <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> at the further part adjacent to the Country of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> ſo that between them it is not forty miles. The City of <hi>Durham</hi> it ſelfe being juſt in the mid way: which when they hear that <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> is taken, can have little hopes to build upon to ſtand out againſt the two Armies.</p>
               <p>By this time there is no doubt but <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> is in the hands of the Scots, it being a fortnight ſince the Meſſenger that brought this Meſſage left them in this condition.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154590:5"/>
               <p> The Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſeeing that now he can do no more miſchief in that Country, hath fired and burnt down (as it is ſuppoſed) nigh an hundred houſes, and all the goods of ſo many poor families in the Suburbs of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle;</hi> notwithſtanding the cryes of many poor widowes and fatherleſſe children, that begged of him with teares, to refrain from the doing thereof.</p>
